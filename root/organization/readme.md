# Microsoft Extraction System: Flask & Django Integration

This system provides robust email extraction from Microsoft Outlook mailboxes using both a Flask backend (for extraction logic) and a Django API (for orchestration and integration with other services).

---

## Overview
- **Flask Server**: Handles the actual extraction, pausing, continuing, and cancelling of email extraction jobs. Communicates with Microsoft Graph API and the database.
- **Django Server**: Provides a REST API for clients, manages requests, and forwards them to the Flask server. Also provides Swagger UI for easy testing.

---

## Running the Servers

### 1. Flask Server
```
cd extractions/microsoft/OutlookMail
python app.py
```
- Runs on: `http://localhost:3006`

### 2. Django Server
```
cd root/organization
python manage.py runserver
```
- Runs on: `http://localhost:8000`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/swagger/`

## Flask API Endpoints for email extraction

### Single User Extraction
- `POST /api/emails/extract/start/<connection_id>`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/pause/<connection_id>`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/continue/<connection_id>`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/cancel/<connection_id>`
- `GET /api/emails/extract/status/<connection_id>`
- `GET /api/emails/extract/result/<connection_id>`

### Batch Extraction
- `POST /api/emails/extract/batch/start`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/batch/pause/<batch_id>`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/batch/continue/<batch_id>`
- `POST /api/emails/extract/batch/cancel/<batch_id>`
- `GET /api/emails/extract/batch/status/<batch_id>`
- `GET /api/emails/extract/batch/result/<batch_id>`

## Integration Notes
- The Django server acts as a proxy and orchestrator, forwarding requests to the Flask server.
- Both servers must be running for the system to function.
- Use the Django Swagger UI for easy API testing.
- All configuration (tenant ID, client ID, client secret) can be provided in the request body or as environment variables.
- Pausing and continuing works even after a server restart, as long as the store file is preserved (tracked by connection_id or batch_id).
- Cancelled or completed tasks cannot be resumed.
